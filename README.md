## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the frontend pages and components inside the `/_frontend` folder. These edits are automatically re-rendered.
You can start editing the backend endpoints inside the `/_backend` folder. These edits are *not* automatically re-built. The server must be rebuilt first.

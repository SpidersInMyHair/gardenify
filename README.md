## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

It is important to run this dev build instead of running npm start.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the frontend pages and components inside the `/_frontend` folder. These edits are automatically re-rendered.
You can start editing the backend endpoints inside the `/_backend` folder. These edits are *not* automatically re-built. The server must be rebuilt first.

Protogen can also be used. A protogen script exists in ./bin. You 
should provide a input file for the protogen generation.
